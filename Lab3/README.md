### Joint Orientation
- Correct joint orientation is vital for realistic animations and skinning, as it ensures natural joint movements and prevents issues like gimbal lock.
### Joint Placement
- Joint placement is also important for realistic animations and skinning, as it ensures natural joint movements and prevents issues like gimbal lock.
### Skinning
- Skinning is the process of binding a mesh to a skeleton. This is done by assigning vertices to joints, and then assigning weights to those vertices. The weights determine how much a vertex is affected by a joint. For example, if a vertex has a weight of 1 for a joint, it will move with that joint. If it has a weight of 0.5, it will move with the joint, but only half as much. If it has a weight of 0, it will not move with the joint at all.
### Weight Painting
- Weight painting is the process of assigning weights to vertices. This is done by painting on the mesh with a brush tool. The brush tool can be used to paint weights on a mesh, and the weights can be adjusted by painting over them with a different brush tool.
### Rig Optimization
- Rig optimization is the process of reducing the number of joints in a rig. This is done by removing joints that are not needed, and by combining joints that are close together.
