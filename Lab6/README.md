# Lab 6: Custom UIs and Advanced Scripting:

## Assets
If you would like to look at my python tools used in this lab, you can find them in my separate [MayaPythonToolbox](https://github.com/Azothyr/MayaPythonToolbox) git repo. I mainly went over the joint UI tool but there are many more you can view.
